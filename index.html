        <li class="list-group-item"> Within the team, we hold years of IT, project management, law and financial experience, meaning a diverse knowledge base is held. In terms of IT, the experience is that of a software developer with experience in linux server maintenance.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"> We are investors for life, and visualise the magnitude of impact that Cardano, and other blockchain projects, will have on future society.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"> We set parameters based on what we think is balanced. Fair wealth creation for all creates trust, bringing more delegators to Axios, and more distributable rewards.</li>
