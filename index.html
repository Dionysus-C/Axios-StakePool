  <h3> <u> What is our mission? </u> </h3>
  <p> To generate people from all walks of life passive income of value. </p>

  <h3> <u>What's in it for me?</u> </h3>
  <p>We understand and appreciate the principles of ‘incentivization’, something Charles Hoskinson recognises as important. Support us, and the system will consistently repay the favour<p>

  <h3> <u>Why delegate with Axios?</u> </h3>
  <ol>  Within the team, we hold years of IT, project management, law and financial experience, meaning a diverse knowledge base is held. In terms of IT, the experience is that of  “………………..”</ol>
  <ol>  We are investors for life, and visualise the magnitude of impact that Cardano, and other blockchain projects, will have on future society.</ol>
  <ol>  We set parameters based on what we think is balanced. Fair wealth creation for all creates trust, bringing more delegators to Axios, and more distributable rewards.</ol>

  <h3> <u>So, what does this all mean?</u> </h3>
  <p> Stake with confidence, and focus on other things which bring you value. </p>
