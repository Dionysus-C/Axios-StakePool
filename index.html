    Why delegate with Axios?
   Within the team, we hold years of IT, project management, law and financial experience, meaning a diverse knowledge base is held. In terms of IT, the experience is that of a software developer with experience in linux server maintenance.
   We are investors for life, and visualise the magnitude of impact that Cardano, and other blockchain projects, will have on future society.
       We set parameters based on what we think is balanced. Fair wealth creation for all creates trust, bringing more delegators to Axios, and more distributable rewards.
